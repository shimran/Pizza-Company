Triangulator App
by Shimran George

Functionality:

The purpose of this app is to output information regarding the number of slices a particular pie has for the ShimCity Pizza Co., given the sizes and types of toppings available.

Due to the artisinal nature of ShimCity Pizza Co., all the pepperoni is locally sorced for Pacific NW pork. Cured by Olympic Provisions. Thus, each pepperoni pie will have fewer slices per pie to ensure sufficient pepperoni to complement the locally sourced cheese. The app compensates for that by allowing for the user to select the options for the pepperoni and the size pizza.

User-selected-inputs then get pushed into newPizza object and a numSlices() function evaluates a series of conditional branching to output the correct amount of slices.


Future Functionality:

This app is a work in progress. Currently the ShimCity Pizza Co. only offers two styles of pie in order to preserve its heritage and for quality control. However, future toppings may be added in the future.

Price computation functionality will be added in future releases of this app. Furthermore, future provisions for online payment and ordering options can be added and a back-end queue system can be built.

With future database usage, client information and previous orders can be managed for potential returns or order cancellations.
